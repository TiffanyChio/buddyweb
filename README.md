# Buddy - Front-End Web Component
Buddy is a personal safety mobile app with three main features:
1. Users can invite friends to follow along on their trips using a web browser. Friends do not need to download the app!
2. At the press of a button, the trip page will be updated with a danger status. Additionally emergency contacts saved to the app will get a text alert. 
3. The Check-In feature sends a text alert to emergency contacts if the user has not returned to a saved location (home, work, or school) within a designated time period.
